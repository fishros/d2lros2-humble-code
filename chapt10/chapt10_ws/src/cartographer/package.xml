  We add 900 to the patch part of the version and then multiply it by 10,
  i.e. our version = `(upstream_patch_version + 900) * 10`,
  so we can have intermediate releases as well as release any future official 2.0.x versions.

  This is basically packing the patch part of the version and a fourth version part together
  into the third part of the version.

  The use of `900` instead of something else like `100` is arbitrary, but it might
  help people recognize that this is a "special" version number.
  It is needed however, because we cannot have a leading `0` in our patch version.

  Consider these possible future versions as an example:

  2.0.9000 -> current state of this repository, 2.0.0 + some commits from us
  2.0.9010 -> upstream 2.0.1
  2.0.9011 -> upstream 2.0.1 + additional commits from upstream or us
  2.0.9012 -> upstream 2.0.1 + additional commits from 2.0.1011 + more new commits
  2.0.9020 -> upstream 2.0.2
  and so on...

  <version>2.0.9002</version>
